#### Generate an example Java code for an Apache Pulsar application to solve the most common real-time streaming problem.

Here is an example of a Java application that uses Apache Pulsar to solve a common real-time streaming problem: counting the number of occurrences of a specific word in a stream of text data.

First, we need to set up a Pulsar client and create a topic to publish the data to:

````
PulsarClient pulsarClient = PulsarClient.builder()
        .serviceUrl("pulsar://localhost:6650")
        .build();

TopicName topicName = TopicName.get("persistent://my-tenant/my-namespace/my-topic");
Producer<String> producer = pulsarClient.newProducer(Schema.STRING)
        .topic(topicName)
        .create();
````

Next, we can create a Pulsar Function that counts the occurrences of a specific word in the stream of data:

````
public class WordCountFunction implements Function<String, Integer> {

    private final String word;

    public WordCountFunction(String word) {
        this.word = word;
    }

    @Override
    public Integer process(String input, Context context) {
        int count = 0;
        String[] words = input.split(" ");
        for (String w : words) {
            if (w.equalsIgnoreCase(word)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

}
````

Then, we can create a Pulsar Function that uses the WordCountFunction to count the occurrences of a specific word in the stream of data and write the results to a new topic:

````
public class WordCountFunctionWrapper implements Function<String, Void> {

    private final String word;
    private final PulsarClient pulsarClient;
    private final TopicName outputTopic;

    public WordCountFunctionWrapper(String word, PulsarClient pulsarClient, TopicName outputTopic) {
        this.word = word;
        this.pulsarClient = pulsarClient;
        this.outputTopic = outputTopic;
    }

    @Override
    public Void process(String input, Context context) {
        int count = new WordCountFunction(word).process(input, context);
        try {
            Producer<Integer> producer = pulsarClient.newProducer(Schema.

````
        
#### Generate an example Java code for an Apache Pulsar application to solve the most common real-time streaming problem.

One common real-time streaming problem is the need to process and analyze high volumes of data as it is generated, in order to identify trends and patterns in near real-time. Here is an example Java code that uses Apache Pulsar to solve this problem:

````
import org.apache.pulsar.client.api.PulsarClient;
import org.apache.pulsar.client.api.PulsarClientException;
import org.apache.pulsar.client.api.SubscriptionType;
import org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Consumer;
import org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Message;
import org.apache.pulsar.client.api.MessageId;

public class RealTimeStreamingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws PulsarClientException {
        // Create a Pulsar client
        PulsarClient client = PulsarClient.builder()
            .serviceUrl("pulsar://localhost:6650")
            .build();

        // Subscribe to a topic
        Consumer<byte[]> consumer = client.newConsumer()
            .topic("my-topic")
            .subscriptionType(SubscriptionType.Exclusive)
            .subscribe();

        // Process messages as they are received
        while (true) {
            Message msg = consumer.receive();
            try {
                // Extract the data from the message
                byte[] data = msg.getData();

                // Perform analysis on the data to identify trends and patterns
                // ...

                // Acknowledge the message once processing is complete
                consumer.acknowledge(msg);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // If there is an error, negative acknowledge the message
                // to allow it to be redelivered
                consumer.negativeAcknowledge(msg);
            }
        }
    }
}
````

In this example, the code creates a Pulsar client and subscribes to a topic. It then enters a loop and waits for messages to be received. When a message is received, the data is extracted and processed to identify trends and patterns. Once processing is complete, the message is acknowledged, and the loop continues to process the next message. If there is an error during processing, the message is negatively acknowledged to allow it to be redelivered.
